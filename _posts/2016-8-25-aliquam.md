### FERPA - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT

Provides parents and eligible students (at least 18 years old or attending a post-secondary school) with four basic rights:  
(1) the right to review educational records  
(2) the right to correct or delete inaccurate information in records  
(3) the right to limit the disclosure of records containing personally identifiable information  
(4) the right to file a complaint about non-compliance with the Department of Education  

Three main obligations under FERPA:  
• Parental consent  
• Maintain documentation of disclosure and access request  
• Notification of rights  

What does this mean for staff?  

•Secure materials that have confidential student information on them before stepping away from your desk.  
• Limit discussion of confidential information to staff who have a job-related reason to know.  
• Exercise caution so that other persons (staff or visitors) do not inadvertently overhear discussions involving confidential information.
